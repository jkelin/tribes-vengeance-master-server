This repository is a failsafe for when QTracker GameSpy emulation service goes offline. It contains results of my investigation into TribesVengeance master server protocol. [TribesVengeanceMasterServer](TribesVengeanceMasterServer) contains working master server.

Reference materials

[reference](reference) folder contains semi-working example of how to do this in C# and C PInvoke.

All required information can be found here http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers.htm

[GameSpy SDK Help.chm](GameSpySDKHelp.chm) desribes qr2 protocol that servers use when communicating with master. This information is however not really required.
